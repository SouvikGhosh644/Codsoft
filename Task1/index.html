            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was an influential leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule.
                He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, India. Bose is famous for his role as the founder
                and
                leader of the Indian National Army (INA) and his strong belief in armed struggle to achieve
                independence.</p>

        <section id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Bose completed his education in England and was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda
                and Sri Aurobindo. He joined the Indian National Congress and rose to prominence with his efforts to
                unite
                various factions within the party. However, he became disillusioned with the party's moderate approach
                and
                sought more radical means to achieve independence.</p>

        <section id="ina">
            <h2>Indian National Army</h2>
            <p>Bose's most significant contribution to the independence movement was the formation of the Indian
                National
                Army (INA) in 1942. The INA fought alongside the Japanese forces against the British during World War
                II.
                Bose's leadership and charisma inspired thousands of Indian soldiers to join the INA, with the aim of
                liberating India from British rule.</p>

            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's dedication and sacrifice for India's freedom make him a revered figure in Indian
                history. His slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom" still resonates with the spirit of
                patriotism. Bose's legacy continues to inspire generations to fight for justice, freedom, and equality.
